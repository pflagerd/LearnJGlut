# learnjglut

This is a learning platform for jglut.

The idea is to use some templates to create programs from redbook-1.1 in order to learn jglut.

jglut closely matches the syntax of freeglut for C, and it includes all of gl 1.1 and glu 1.3 as well.

It runs identically on Linux or Windows.



### build

You will need eclipse. To obtain the eclipse that was used to build and run learnjglut for Linux, retrieve it from here.
